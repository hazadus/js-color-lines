## TODOs:

### Logic
- Ball moving (with pathfinding)
- Add three random balls after each move
- Detect lines (straight, diagonal) of same color
- Track game score
- Save highscore

### UI
- Full width (with padding) on mobile screen
- Score field
- Highscore field
- Next colors (?)

### System
- Save game state in local storage, restore on page reload.
